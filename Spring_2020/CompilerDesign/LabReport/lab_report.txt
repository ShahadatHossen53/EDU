Experiment Names=>
        1. Write a program to check whether a given string is a comment or not.
        1. Write a program to devide comment and not comment section.
        3. Write a program to check whether a given string is valid identifier or not.
        4. Write a program to classify the operators and print their type.
        5. Write a program to check the valid or invalid string of following:
                i. a*
                ii. a*b
        6. Write a program to check wherther a given string is valid expression or not.
        7. Write a program to determine the first and follow of a given grammar.
        
<------------------------------------------->

Objectives=>
        1. In source code of a program, programmer writes comments for understand easily the source code. But those comments are not     
           part of the code. This program is about to determine a given line is a comment or not.
      
        2. In source code of a program, programmer writes comments for understand easily the source code. But those comments are not     
           part of the code. This program is about to determine the type of existing comments in a given string.
    
        3. In programming there are some rules for write an identifier name. Invalid identifier name are not acceptable for             
           programming. This programming is for define a identifier name is valid or invalid.
           
        4. In C programming there are several types of operator (arithmetic operator,assignment operator, logical operator etc.). This 
           program takes input operator and define the type of that operator.
       
        5. Regular expressions are part of grammar. It’s used for how a machine works. It will accept or reject the input. This program 
           is about to determine a given string is accepted or not for expression ‘a*b’ or 'a*'.
       
        6. In programming language expression is the main thing. Without expression no program can run.This program can determine an
           expression is valid or not;
   
        7. This program is about to determine the first and follow of a given CFG.
